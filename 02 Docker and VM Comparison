1. Docker on OS Level
2. Different Levels of abstraction
3. Why Linux-based docker containers dont run on Windows

Operating System
----------------
2 Layers:
Applications
OS Kernel
Hardware

Kernel communicates with hardware
Applications run on Kernel layer

The difference is there on the layer which is virtualized.

Docker virtualizes the Applications Layer and uses the Kernel of the host.
Virtual Box on the other hand has applications layer on its own kernel. So, it virtualizes its complete OS.
It puts up its own Kernel on the Hardware.

SIZE:
The size of Docker is very small because they have to implement its own layer.

FAST:
Docker are faster than VMs.

COMPATIBILTY:
VM of any OS can run on any OS host.
Older version than Windows 10 and MAC we cannot So, 1st step while installing is to check whether your hosts can actually run Docker nativally. Which means is the kernel comapatible with Docker images.
So, a workaround is that you install a technology called Docker Toolbox which abstracts way the kernel to make it possible for your hosts to run differernt docker images.


COMPONENTS
----------
Docker Engine: Important to run
Docker CLI Client : Execute Docker Commands
Docker Composer : Orchestrate if you have multiple containers
