WHAT IS CONTAINER?
------------------
A way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.
Portable artifact, easily shared and moved around.
Make development and deployment more efficient

WHERE DO CONTAINERS LIVE?
-------------------------
Container Repository
Private repo
Public repo for Docker

HOW CONTAINERS IMRPOVE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS?
-------------------------------------------
Before Containers:
Each person had to install binaries on their system.
Command could go wrong and all.

After Containers:
Own isolated environmnent
Packaged with all needed configuration
one command to install the app
run same app with 2 different versions.


APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT
----------------------
Before Containers:
1. Deployment Team will produce artifacts together with a set of instructions and configure those artifcats on servers. So, you would have a jar file or somthing
2. Then DT will sent it to the operations team and will set the enviroment of those application.

Configuration on the server needed.
Dependency version conflicts
textual guide of deployment
misunderstandings

After Containers:
Developers and Operations work together to package the application in a container.
No enviromental configuration needed on server - except Docker Runtime

TECHINALLY WHAT IS CONTAINER
-----------------------------
Layer of images
Mostly Linux Base Image, because small is size
Application image on top

Separate images are downloaded 
Different layers are downloaded so when downloading next version there will be no issue

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOCKER IMAGE AND CONTAINER
---------------------------------------------
1. Image is the actual package
2. Image is the artifact that can be moved around
3. So basically when it is not moving then it is image

1. Docker Container starts the application
2. Container enviroment is created
3. When it is being used then it is container i.e. when I download the image to my local computer.
