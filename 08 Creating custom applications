1. Create Docker File: Write Command and instructions inside that and fyrthur being processed by the docker client.
2. Docker Client gives this file to Docker Server and commands that are insatlled in the system.
3. Custom Image after processing.

Behind the Scenes:
Set of instructions are written in the DockerFile.
Passed to CLI.

Step-01:
Custom Image is empty
Foremost what we are gonna do is take a copy of OS and deploy up in the Custome Image

Step-02:
Take the files in the Custom Image and make a temporary container out of it.
Install the program on the temporary container.

Step-03:
Replace the existing files in the custom image with the container one.
Continer is kind-of deleting (caching)
